# Connect Four Game

This is a Connect Four game implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming principles. The game incorporates Git for version control, allowing for easy collaboration and tracking of changes.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: The game is designed using classes and objects to represent the board, players, and game logic, promoting modularity and maintainability.

- **Player-Switching Logic**: The game alternates between two players, allowing each player to take turns placing their tiles on the board.

- **Win Conditions**: The game checks for win conditions after each move to determine if a player has won. Win conditions are checked for consistent tiles in rows, columns, and diagonals.

- **Algorithmic Checks**: The win conditions are implemented using algorithmic checks to efficiently verify the presence of four consecutive tiles in any direction.

## Usage

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the Connect Four game code.

2. **Compile the Code**: Compile the `connect4.cpp` file using a C++ compiler. For example:
g++ connect4.cpp -o connect4

3. **Run the Game**: Execute the compiled binary file to start the game.

4. **Follow On-Screen Instructions**: Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. Players take turns placing their tiles on the board, and the game continues until one player wins or the board is full (resulting in a draw).

## About Connect Four

Connect Four is a two-player connection board game in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
